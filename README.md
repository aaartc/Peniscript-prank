# How to use peniscript

1. Get a browser extension that allows you to run userscripts on websites (for example, Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey, etc).
2. Enable this extension and allow it to run userscripts on websites in browser extensions settings.
3. Create a new script in your extension and fill the metadata.
4. Copy and paste all the code from psc.js to your newly created script.

### And here we go!
Now the mouse cursor on website will be replaced by a penis and right click will make a cumshot.
